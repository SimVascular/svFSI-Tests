# Mesh data

   Set mesh as fibers: t

   Mesh file path: mesh/pfib_LV.vtu

   # We need to provide domains to specifiy properties for solving
   # the equation. For e.g., fluid density and viscosity should be
   # provided for fluid, material properties for solid, etc. For
   # electrophysiology, we need to provide information on whether
   # the individual cell is a pacemaker cell or a regular myocyte.
   # This domain information needs to provided here. 

   # The file below is an ASCII file with number of lines the same
   # as the number of elements. Each line will idenfity the domain
   # number.
   Domain file path: mesh/domain_pfib_LV.dat

   # If there is only one uniform domain, a constant value may be
   # provided as,
   # # Domain: 0. 

   # If there are many domains, a vtu file may also be provided
   # with an element-based variable "DOMAIN_ID"
   # # Domain file path: mesh/multiple-domains.vtu

   # The domain id's for the left and right ventricles need not
   # be different if the domains' properties are same. However,
   # we still need to provide a file as input as the number
   # of elements of LV and RV are different.
